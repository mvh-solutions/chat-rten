    "Tyndale Study Notes": [
      "The truth that God loved the world is basic to Christian understanding ( 1 Jn 4:9-10 ). God’s love extends beyond the limits of race and nation, even to those who oppose him. • The Son came to save—not condemn ( Jn 3:17 )—men and women who habitually embrace the darkness ( Jn 3:19-21 )."
